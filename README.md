# Data Analysis for RNA-seq data course 2025

## Preparations
1. For the course you need to bring a laptop with the following installed:
	- [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) - If you already have an existing installation of R, please make sure that your R version is 4.4 or higher
	- [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/)
  
	If you have problems with the installation, take a look at [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p8F_wreHTzw) on how to install R and RStudio.

2. Once you have installed R and RStudio, please go to the [exercises](exercises/) page. There you will find two exercises to verify that everyone has a working R installation setup before the course and provides a recap on first steps in R. *Please take a look at both exercises and upload the output by Friday 21 Nov 13:00 to [this heibox folder](https://heibox.uni-heidelberg.de/u/d/3fc775beeacb4bcba12b/).*
